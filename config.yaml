  # Minimum patients per stage for Kaplan-Meier curves.
  # Rationale: Following Harrell (2015), a minimum of 10-20 events
  # per group is recommended for stable survival estimates.
  # With ~40% event rate in this cohort, n=15 provides
  # approximately 6 expected events, representing a pragmatic
  # balance between statistical stability and stage inclusion.
